# Northcoders News API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

In order to use this database, please create two new files called .env.test and .env.development.

Once you have done this, run command NPM install in your terminal to install all the dependencies.
